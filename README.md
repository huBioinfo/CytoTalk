# CytoTalk<br />
### Version 1.0 (Mar 4th, 2020)<br />

### Overview<br />
Cell-cell communication in a tissue microenvironment is mediated by signal transduction pathways. Single-cell technology has opened the door for studying signal transduction at much higher resolution in a complex tissue. Currently, there is a lack of analytical methods to infer signal transduction pathways based on single-cell omics data. Here we introduce a computational method, CytoTalk, to construct signal transduction networks using single-cell RNA-Seq data. The method first constructs intracellular and intercellular gene-gene interaction networks using an information-theoretic measure between two cell types. Candidate signal transduction pathways in the integrated network are identified using the prize-collecting Steiner forest (PCSF) algorithm. CytoTalk is implemented using MATLAB (version > R2017a), R (version > 3.5.0) and Python (version 2.7).
