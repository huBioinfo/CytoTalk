Description: Perform de novo construction of signal transduction networks using
	single-cell transcriptomic data (scRNA-seq). The CytoTalk process
	constructs an integrated network of intra- and inter-cellular functional
	gene interactions, generating useful graphical output for investigation of
	cell-cell communication within and between cell types. CytoTalk attempts to
	find the optimal subnetwork in the integrated network that includes genes
	with high levels of cell-type-specific expression and close connection to
	highly active ligand-receptor pairs. It takes into account metrics like as
	Preferential Expression Measure (PEM), mutual information between proteins,
	gene relevance, and non-self-talk score.
